# A GMRA Approach to Workout Optimization

**Author**: Evan Wells  

## Abstract

The goal of this project was to design and implement a workout application that leverages **Role-Based Collaboration (RBC)** and **Group Multi-Role Assignment (GMRA)** to dynamically assign exercises based on user input. The app allows users to specify the number of exercises and target muscle groups, generating personalized workout plans for each gym session. By combining a 3D human body model and GMRA, the app ensures efficient and effective workout routines, optimizing user training based on targeted muscle groups.
